# Dyna&omega;o-algorithms - Documentation

This directory contains LaTeX sources for Dyna&omega;o-algorithms documentation.

You can download Dyna&omega;o-algorithms documentation [here](https://github.com/dynawo/dynawo-algorithms/releases/download/v1.4.1/DynawoAlgorithmsDocumentation.pdf).

Scripts:
* **compile.sh**: compile each separated LaTex document (except the licenses).
* **dynawo_algorithms_documentation.sh**: merge all LaTex files to create the complete Dyna&omega;o-algorithms documentation.
* **clean.sh**: remove all latex temporary files and pdf.

For the moment those scripts should be launched from this directory to work properly.
